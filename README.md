# data-scout-terraform

Work in progress, I've run a lot of tests and got some pieces of it working great! Unfortunately I am still working on getting the ECS running
with the image I pushed to ECR. I get the feeling that something is up with the load balancer, so I tried setting up cloudwatch, but have been unsuccessful seeing logs!
